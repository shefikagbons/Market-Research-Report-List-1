<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market consists of two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors within each tire to monitor pressure in real-time, providing accurate and immediate feedback to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, estimates tire pressure through the vehicle's ABS sensors by analyzing wheel rotation speed differences, which may not always reflect actual tire pressure. Both systems aim to enhance vehicle safety and efficiency by alerting drivers to tire pressure issues.</p></p>
